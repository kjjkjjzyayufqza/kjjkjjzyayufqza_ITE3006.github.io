				  Kita, which means “north” in Japanese, is one of the city’s two downtown hubs (the other is the Minami
				  , or “south,” district). Kita is also known as Umeda, which is the name of one of the main train 
				  stations here. You’ll probably spend a lot of time in this part of the city. It’s just three stops 
				  south of Shin-Osaka Station on the Midosuji subway line. And, if you’re coming from Kyoto on the 
				  regular JR Line or one of the two private lines that connect the cities, you’ll arrive here.

                  <h3> Take a Stroll in the Sky at the Umeda Sky Building</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  The Umeda Sky Building is about ten minutes away from JR Osaka Station on foot. The 
				  unique shape of this sightseeing spot attracts visitors from all over the world.
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/kita01.jpeg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  The top sections of two skyscrapers are connected by a circular corridor, and
				  you can get up to the corridor through a direct elevator or the escalator. The
				  open-air corridor, 173 meters above the ground, offers a 360-degree panoramic view.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  At night, the floor underfoot lights up, making it appear as if you were 
				  walking on the Milky Way, creating a magical landscape together with the 
				  Osaka cityscape below.

				  <h3> Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street </h3>
				  
				  <p>
				  Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street in Osaka’s Kita district stretches a 
				  whopping 2.5 kilometers long. More importantly, it’s home to over 600 
				  shops and restaurants to browse. Its mix of old and screamingly new might
				  prove to be sensory overload at times, but it’ll give you a great insight
				  into one of Osaka’s oldest merchant areas.
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/kita02.jpg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  Visiting a shopping arcade in Japan is usually a great insight into what
				  makes a local neighborhood tick. One of the nation’s most famous is 
				  Tenjinbashi-suji Shopping Street, located in Tenma, one of Osaka’s oldest
				  merchant areas. Purportedly one of the country’s longest covered shopping 
				  arcades, it stretches a whopping 2.5 kilometers long. It begins from around
				  Tenjinbashi-suji Rokuchome Subway Station, and ends just before Tenjinbashi Bridge.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  While parts of it are changing rapidly in response to the influx of tourists, 
				  there’s still plenty in the way of neighbourhood shops and restaurants, giving 
				  the street a significantly more local feel than its more commercial counterparts,
				  such as Ebisubashi-suji or Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping streets. It’s not all tourist
				  tat, but you’ll find anything and everything here, even the kitchen sink - clothes,
				  futons, sundries, groceries, old-fashioned tea shops, books, phone accessories, 
				  charming cafes, tiny restaurants, and more.

                  <h3> Ginzaya </h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  Want to drink and eat well on the cheap with Osakan locals? Head over to standing izakaya
				  Ginzaya near Osaka Station to start off your night of bar-hopping. A draft beer is just
				  JPY330, which bodes well for the evening ahead!
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/kita03.jpg" width=100% />
				  
				  <p>
				  A tachinomi-ya, or standing-and-drinking bar, is one of the great subsets of the izakaya
				  (traditional sake pub) genre of eateries in Japan. It’s exactly as the name sounds:
				  you stand here drinking, and have delicious izakaya food to boot. Yes, you might be 
				  on your feet for a while, but it means that mingling with the locals is much easier 
				  since you’re all cozied up together at close quarters. And, if you’re at a popular 
				  place waiting in line, you probably won’t be waiting too long: turnover tends to be 
				  marginally faster at the standing bars.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  Buried deep in the bowels of the Osaka Ekimae Daiichi Building, Ginzaya is a standing
				  izakaya bar drawing salarymen by the dozen after the daily grind is over. It’s not
				  hard to see why. For one thing, a draft beer (Sapporo) is just JPY330, and most 
				  alcoholic drinks on the menu average out at JPY200 to JPY400. It’s damned good 
				  value for money, and makes it easy to keep on quaffing!

				  <h3> Harukoma </h3>
				  
				  <p>
				  With generous fish portions for their sushi at fantastically reasonable prices,
				  it’s no wonder Harukoma in the Tenjinbashisuji Shopping Arcade sees lines out
				  the door for lunch! Locals love this place and so will visitors.
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/kita04.jpg" />
					
					<p>
					Harukoma is one of those well-loved local Osakan institutions that has a 
					permanent queue outside its doors. The line starts even before it opens 
					for lunch! The sushi here isn’t the city’s best by any stretch of the 
					imagination, but the cost-performance here is hard to beat.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Most pieces here are very decent, and even if they’re not top quality,
					they’re pretty damn satisfying for what you’re paying. At Harukoma, you
					can eat until you’re stuffed and not end up spending very much at all.
					And, warm, English-friendly service is a major plus point for any 
					visitor to Osaka!
