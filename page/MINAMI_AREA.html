			Located around Namba Station, Minami <font size="5">(ミナミ, "South")</font> is one of Osaka's two major 
				  city centers. It is the city's most famous entertainment district and offers abundant
				  dining and shopping choices. The district is easily accessible as it is served by 
				  three train companies as well as three subway lines and a highway bus terminal. The 
				  other major city center is Kita (キタ, "North") which is located around Osaka and Umeda stations.

                  <h3> Traditional Shopping Street - Hunt for Japan-Made Souvenirs</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  There are various shotengai (shopping streets) throughout the Minami area, but we’ll introduce 
				  two shotengai that are fun to explore. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/minami01.jpeg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  First is Shinsaibashi Shotengai. Over 180 stores are concentrated here, extending from Dotonbori
				  to Shinsaibashi. Established Osaka department store Daimaru, selling both domestic and international
				  fashion brands, is also on the corner of this shotengai. Many employees here speak English, and 
				  there are also English signs and displays, so you can shop with peace of mind. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  One more shotengai contains many restaurants unique to Minami. The Sennichimae Doguyasuji 
				  shotengai is a three-minute walk from Namba Station (use the Osaka Metro Midosuji or Yotsubashi
				  Line). Here you will find rows of specialty shops with everything you need in for a restaurant,
				  such as knives, pots, and bowls. There are also places where you can create the food samples
				  seen at the entrances of restaurants in Japan. Some shops will even let you make your own samples,
				  making this the perfect place for obtaining memorabilia from your trip.
				  </p>

				  
				  <h3> Cruising on the Dotonbori River </h3>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/minami02.jpg" />
				  <p>
				  Try the cruise along the Dotonbori River to take in another view of the neighborhood. The 
				  cruise also allows visitors to take a break from the crowds. The boarding point is visible
				  from the center of Dotonbori. Tickets cost 900 yen for adults and 400 yen for children. The
				  ride is sure to make your time in Dotonbori all the more special.

                  <h3> Enjoy Classic Osaka Ramen</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  Kinryu Ramen, marked by the gigantic dragon on the roof, is a popular spot in Dotonbori.
				  The restaurant is open 24 hours a day and is ideal for late nights. It is known for its
				  simple ramen menu and unlimited toppings to customize your noodles, like kimchi and chives. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/minami05.jpg" width=100% />
				  
				  <p>
				  Pictured above is part of the dining space. Tatami mats and tables are placed on small
				  stands, on which customers eat ramen while being watched by people passing by. There 
				  are also similar mats and low tables located inside. The classic ramen here is made 
				  with pork bone broth and is rich in flavor. Each bowl is priced reasonably (from around
				  600 yen). If you want to truly experience food in Osaka, Kinryu Ramen is the place to
				  visit. We highly recommend trying the ramen at this restaurant.

				  <h3> Crab and a Sit-down Meal at a Famous Restaurant </h3>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/minami06.jpg" />
				  <p>
				  Famous for its moving crab sign, Kani Doraku is also recommended for visitors
				  wanting to enjoy a sit-down meal. This is a higher-end restaurant with a menu
				  that includes fresh crab, hot pot, and even traditional Japanese kaiseki cuisine.
				  The dishes here are high-quality and exquisite. They also serve crabs to go.
