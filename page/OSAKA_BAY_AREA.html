                  <h3> Osaka Aquarium </h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  Osaka Aquarium is one of the city’s premier attractions, and one of the best aquariums in
				  the world. It does come with a slightly expensive price tag, but we think it’s worth it. 
				  Just be prepared for crowds.

 
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/osakabay01.jpg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  The Osaka Bay area is home to some great attractions, and one of the best reasons to 
				  make the trek out is the Osaka Aquarium. Known as Kaiyukan in Japanese, it’s one of
				  the best aquariums in the world. With 15 tanks housing an astonishing variety of ocean
				  life from the Pacific Rim, it is a fantastic day out for adults and children alike.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  In the central tank alone, you’ll see large fish like whale sharks, manta rays,
				  tiger sharks, leopard sharks, and a variety of smaller but beautiful fish. Then 
				  there are the surrounding smaller tanks where you can see fish and other marine
				  mammals. 2013 saw the opening of a new interactive area where visitors can get 
				  up close to some of the animals - it’s probably the only chance you’ll have in
				  your life to really interact with, for instance, a rockhopper penguin!

				  <h3> Tempozan Ferris Wheel </h3>
				  
				  <p>
				  Those who like high places and city views should take a ride on the Tempozan 
				  Ferris Wheel. Reaching a height of 112 meters, this Ferris wheel offers 
				  incredible views of the Bay Area, Osaka, and Kobe. Worth the money if you
				  like this sort of thing!
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/osakabay02.jpg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  If you’re in the Osaka Bay area, you are very likely visiting the aquarium 
				  or Universal Studios. But if you’re around the aquarium with an extra 
				  15 minutes to spare, consider a ride on the Tempozan Ferris Wheel.
				  </p>
					
				  <p>
				  At 112 meters tall, it’s one of the largest Ferris wheels in the world,
				  and offers stunning views of Osaka Bay, Osaka City, and even as far as Kobe.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  A ride on the Ferris wheel does cost JPY800 per person, which is rather 
				  steep for about 15 minutes. Still, it’s not too bad if you can spare 
				  the cash, and if you’re going at night the views are particularly lovely.
				  Fantastic if you’re on a romantic date out.

                  <h3> TAKOPA Takoyaki Park </h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  Visiting Universal Studios Japan and craving takoyaki? Never fear - TAKOPA (Takoyaki Park)
				  in Universal City Walk. You can sample your way through five of Osaka’s best shops under
				  a single roof. Efficient and tasty! 
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/osakabay03.jpg" width=100% />
				  
				  <p>
				  It’s hard to imagine there was a time before takoyaki around Universal Studios Japan
				  - that is to say, you couldn’t visit the world-famous theme park in Osaka and also 
				  sample the city’s most famous street food. Well, that changed in 2006 when Universal 
				  City Walk opened TAKOPA (Takoyaki Park).
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  TAKOPA (Takoyaki Park)（改称）is not an actual “museum” in the traditional sense,
				  but a cluster of five famous and popular takoyaki shops under a single roof. These
				  include Kougaryu, Juhachiban, and Yamachan. Normally, you’d have to travel to all
				  these disparate areas around Osaka to eat at each shop, so having all of them right
				  next to each other is a real time-saver for anyone who wants to eat a variety of 
				  great takoyaki without having to sit on trains and buses for a long time.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>

						TAKOPA (Takoyaki Park) Address:<br />
						4F Universal Citywalk Osaka, 6-2-61 Shimaya, Konohana-ku, Osaka-shi, 554-0024

				  <h3> Naniwa Kuishinbo Yokocho </h3>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/osakabay04.jpg" />
				  <p>
				  Located inside the Tempozan Marketplace, this is a faux Edo-era shopping street
				  lined with small restaurants selling all the usual Osaka specialties like 
				  okonomiyaki, takoyaki and kushikatsu. This is the best place to eat in the 
				  Tempozan area, but it can get very crowded – try to go during off-peak hours.
				  </p>
					
				  <p>
				  If you need dining options while you’re visiting the Osaka Aquarium, Naniwa
				  Kuishinbo Yokocho inside the Tempozan Marketplace is by far the best place to
				  eat. It’s a food hall designed to resemble Osaka shopping streets in the 
				  1960s - a warren of around 20 different stalls and eateries serving Osaka
				  B-grade gourmet food.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  B-grade gourmet food tends to be hearty, rib-sticking, and affordable.
				  Think takoyaki (octopus dumplings), okonomiyaki (a cross between a pancake
				  and a frittata), and kushikatsu (battered, deep-fried skewered kebabs). 
				  All of it is reasonably delicious and possibly a tad on the unhealthy side.
				  It doesn’t matter, though, since you’re on holiday. Sample as much as you can!
