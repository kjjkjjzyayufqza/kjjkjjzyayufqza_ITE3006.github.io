                  <h3> Stroll Around Shinsekai</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  While visiting Tsutenkaku Tower, we suggest taking a walk around Shinsekai. Discover great 
				  souvenirs and try local food at the shops lining the streets while enjoying the energetic 
				  local atmosphere. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/tennoji01.jpg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  When trying to describe the distinctive atmosphere of Osaka in Japanese, many people use 
				  the term “kote kote,” which roughly means "energetic, chaotic." Shinsekai is overflowing
				  with this energy and is the perfect area to describe as kote kote. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  Around the entrance to the Shinseikai area is a narrow street called Janjan Alley (Janjan
				  Yokocho in Japanese). It is lined with shops selling kushikatsu (deep-fried skewers of
				  meat or vegetables) and izakayas, or Japanese pubs.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  Games including go and shogi have been also quite popular in this area for many years.
				  Even today, you can see people playing shogi through the house and store windows.
				  </p>

				  
				  <h3> Stroll Around Tennoji Park </h3>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/tennoji02.jpg" />
				  <p>
				  East of the Tsutenkaku Tower lies Tennoji Park, where visitors can take a break in
				  the heart of nature. 
				  </p>
					
				  <p>
				  The nearby areas around Shin Imamiya Station and Dobutsuen Mae Station have seen
				  more backpackers and tourists recently, leading to a rapid increase in the number
				  of affordable accommodations. This makes it a great place to stay, as well as a
				  suitable starting point for sightseeing in Osaka.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  Please note that the area is considered slightly unsafe and shady by the locals
				  so be careful when walking around at night.
				  </p>

                  <h3> Kushikatsu Daruma</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  Located near the base of Tsutenkaku tower in Shinsekai, Daruma is one of the area’s
				  most popular kushikatsu restaurants. If it’s deliciously greasy, deep-fried meat 
				  and veg you’re looking for, your search ends here. Look for the large black and white sign. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/tennoji03.jpg" width=100% />
				  
				  <p>
				  Do you like deep-fried, battered food? Do you like skewers? Then you’ll love 
				  kushikatsu. Invented as cheap fast food for lower-income workers around the 
				  Shinsekai area in the early 20th century, kushikatsu restaurants are popular
				  today with diners of all economic stripes, and for good reason - kushikatsu
				  is just delicious and fun to eat.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  Daruma is one of the area’s most popular restaurants in this genre, with several
				  branches across the city. Anything can be made into kushikatsu, from vegetables 
				  to questionable meat parts to cheese. Even fruit can be battered and deep-fried.
				  Everything is fried to order, and the panko breadcrumb batter is light and crispy
				  when hot and fresh out of the kitchen. Try the 16-skewer set and let the kitchen
				  surprise you with their choice of ingredients!
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
					<font size=2 color=#6495ED>
						Kushikatsu Daruma Address:<br />
						2-3-9 Ebisu-higashi, Naniwa-ku, Osaka-shi, 556-0002
					</font>
				  </p>

				  
				  <h3> Tengu </h3>
				  
				  <p>
				  Can’t be bothered to queue at Daruma? Don’t worry - there’s another kushikatsu 
				  restaurant in Shinsekai that’s just as good, if not better. Tengu is sure to 
				  satisfy all your greasy, deep-fried desires. Just be warned, sometimes there’s
				  a queue here, too.
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/tennoji04.jpg" />
					
				  <p>
				  Tengu stands out in the narrow Jan Jan Arcade for the long, red-nosed demon 
				  above its door for which it’s named. It’s one of many kushikatsu restaurants
				  in the Shinsekai area. Not all kushikatsu are created equal, however. The 
				  queues outside Tengu at peak dining hours are testament to the consistent 
				  quality of its deep-fried skewers.
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  Like most kushikatsu restaurants, the skewers here won’t break the bank. Most
				  vegetables and meats cost around JPY100 - 200 per skewer. An outlier is the 
				  fried shrimp at around JPY450 - but given how large and sweet it is, we think
				  it’s entirely worth the extra expense. Another one to try is the doteyaki - beef
				  tendons stewed in a sweet miso sauce. This local speciality is an acquired 
				  taste but one you should definitely try at least once when you’re traveling through Osaka.
