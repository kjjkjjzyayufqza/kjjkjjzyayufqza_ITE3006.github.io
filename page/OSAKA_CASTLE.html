				The construction of Osaka Castle <font size="5">(大阪城, Ōsakajō)</font> started in 1583 on the former site of the Ishiyama
				Honganji Temple, which had been destroyed by Oda Nobunaga thirteen years earlier. Toyotomi Hideyoshi
				intended the castle to become the center of a new, unified Japan under Toyotomi rule. It was the 
				largest castle at the time.

                  <h3> Osaka Castle Park - Beautiful in Every Season</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  The park surrounding Osaka Castle was opened to the public in 1931 but it wasn't until after World 
				  War II that the area was turned into an urban park. Osaka Castle Park is home to about 600 cherry 
				  trees, a peach grove with about 200 peach trees consisting of 12 different species and 1270 plum 
				  trees in its plum grove.
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/castle01.jpg" />
				  
				  <p>
				  The plum grove is one of the most popular plum blossom viewing spots in Japan. In February,
				  the whole area is covered in dark pink and white blossoms and hundreds of people visit each day.  
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  The peach grove close to the plum grove was opened in 1999. Peach blossoms are so often
				  confused with cherry blossoms which bloom in the same season that many people don't
				  even know about this grove. 
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>
				  When the cherry blossoms are in bloom, all the cherry trees around the castle are lit up 
				  at night, creating a magical cherry blossom viewing experience. In autumn, the area is 
				  full of many different kinds of trees with foliage in all shades of red, orange and yellow.
				  </p>

                  <h3> Takoyaki Doraku Wanaka</h3>
				  
                  <p>
                  The popular store of Osaka Takoyaki "Wanaka" has its main shop at Sennichimae in Osaka.
				  </p>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/castle04.jpg" width=100% />
				  
				  <p>
				  Wanaka's "Takoyaki" (8 pieces for 500 yen, sauce flavor). The dough is delicious!
				  Dashi (broth) works well, and it's nicely done with the right crispiness outside 
				  and the delightful softness and chewiness inside. Aside from the original sauce
				  flavor, there are other choices such as Kamadakishio (salt made by boiling seawater
				  in a flat pot) ·Soy sauce· Doro sauce (originated from Kansai, tangy flavor).

				  <h3> Kobe Butter Crepe Specialty Shop Hysteric Jam </h3>
				  
				  <img src="../images/osaka/castle06.jpg" />
				  <p>
				  Plenty of butter is used for the dough, and the "Saku (crispy)・ Fuwa (fluffy) ・ 
				  Juwa (melty)" texture of the dough is their selling point. Surprisingly, there are
				  over 100 flavors of crepes available! "Matcha Tiramisu" (680 yen) is the most
				  popular item that is loved by the Japanese customers as well as the ones from overseas.
				  </p>
					
				  <p>
				  Plenty of original premium cream is used, and the royal way to eat this is to start
				  with a spoon. There is a large bench in front of the shop so that you can get a seat
				  and take your time to enjoy this delectable goodness.
